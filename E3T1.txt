1. What findings were detected related to the brute force attack?
An SSH Brute Force attack was detected. The severity of the finding is High with the following description:
"i-0ff2023d4432e521a is performing SSH brute force attacks against 10.192.10.234. Brute force attacks are used to gain unauthorized access to your instance by guessing the SSH password."

3. Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information?
The source used by Guard Duty to detect this attack is monitoring traffic on port 22 of the instances. If SSH services are configured to use other ports, this finding is not generated by GuardDuty (documentation used: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_finding-types-ec2.html#unauthorizedaccess-ec2-sshbruteforce).

Searching the documentation the only relevant information seems to be this one:
"Note
This finding is generated only through monitoring traffic on port 22. If your SSH services are configured to use other ports, this finding is not generated."

Hence the source of this type of alert should be monitoring the network traffic flowing to the instance on port 22 - the VPC Flow Logs. Then if multiple SSH login attempts are detected in a certain time frame, an alert is generated.
