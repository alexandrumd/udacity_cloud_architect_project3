1. Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an SSH brute force attack from the internet.
- Using the security groups inbound rules, allow SSH connections only from specific IP ranges
- Disable SSH password login on the web server instance
- Disable SSH logins for root user on the web server instance (a newly created user can be used instead)

2. Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket; even in the instance that API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data?
By using a restrictive IAM policy that would only allow access to the free receipes bucket.
For example the Instance Role policy could be in a form similar to:
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "s3:*",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::cand-c3-free-recipes-523425384697"
}

instead of

{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "s3:*",
    "Resource": "*"
}
