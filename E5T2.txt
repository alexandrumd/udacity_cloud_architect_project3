1. Identify tools that will allow you to do the following: 
a. Scan infrastructure as code templates. 
- Checkov, TFlint, CloudSploit.
b. Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities.
- AquaSec Trivy, Clair, Anchore.
c. Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities.
AWS Config, Prowler.

2. For each tool - identify an example compliance violation or vulnerability which it might expose.
Checkov - "Ensure all data stored in the S3 bucket have versioning enabled"
TFlint - Disallow using invalid engine name for an RDS database, e.g. Warning: "mysql57" is invalid engine.
CloudSploit - 'Ensure the default security groups block all traffic by default' (source: https://github.com/aquasecurity/cloudsploit/blob/2ab02ba4ffcac7ca8122f37d6b453a9679447a32/plugins/aws/ec2/defaultSecurityGroup.js)

Trivy - CVE-2018-14618 - Critical - curl: NTLM password overflow (source: https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/blob/main/imgs/usage1.png)
Clair - similar to Trivy it outputs findings based on the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database (CVE)
Anchore - Notifies based on CVEs as well

AWS Config - securityhub-alb-http-to-https-redirection-check-44b48164 Checks whether HTTP to HTTPS redirection is configured on all HTTP listeners of Application Load Balancers.
Prowler - "Avoid the use of the root account" (source: https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3985464/18489640/50fe6824-79cc-11e6-8a9c-e788b88a8a6b.png)
